Utilize the AWS Key Management Service (AMS KMS) to encrypt data at rest. Create an AWS KMS key, and use it to encrypt Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. In this tutorial, you will also see how AWS CloudTrail provides an audit log of AWS KMS key usage and how disabling the key affects data access.

## Objectives
- Create an AWS KMS customer managed key to encrypt and decrypt data at rest.
- Monitor encryption key usage by using the CloudTrail event history.
- Launch an Amazon EC2 instance with an unencrypted root EBS volume attached.
- Encrypt the root volume of an existing Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Amazon EC2 instance.
- Disable and re-enable an AWS KMS key and observe the effects on data access.
